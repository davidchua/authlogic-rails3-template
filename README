Due to a bug in Rails 3.0.3, you cannot create a template remotely via github's
https till its fixed.

Refer to :
https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/5926

In order to use this, you need to clone this repository, and then do a 

"rails new -m /path/to/localcopy/repo/template.rb"
